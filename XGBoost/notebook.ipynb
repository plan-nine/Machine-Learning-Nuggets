Through this, you'll learn how to create, evaluate, and tune XGBoost models efficiently. There will be time to answer any questions, so please add them!\n\n## **The Dataset**\n\nThe session's dataset is a CSV file named `hotel_bookings_clean.csv`, which contains data on hotel bookings. \n\n### **Acknowledgements**\nThe dataset was downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/). The data is originally from an article called [Hotel booking demand datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It was then cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md). For the purposes of this code-along, it was further pre-processed to have cleaner ready-to-use features (e.g., dropping irrelevant columns, one-hot-encoding).

Your First XGBoost Classifier**\n\nXGBoost has a  [scikit-learn API](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#module-xgboost.sklearn), which is useful if you want to use different scikit-learn classes and methods on an XGBoost model (e.g.,`predict()`, `fit()`).  In this section, we'll try the API out with the `xgboost.XGBClassifier()` class and get a baseline accuracy for the rest of our work. So that our results are reproducible, we'll set the `random_state=123`.\n\nAs a reminder, gradient boosting sequentially trains weak learners where each weak learner tries to correct its predecessor's mistakes. First, we'll instantiate a simple XGBoost classifier without changing any of the other parameters, and we'll inspect the parameters that we haven't touched.","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"W9m1kfpxegsL","tags":[]},"id":"c144c1ff-1553-4b92-a5a9-e15faeac85d9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Train and test split using sklearn\n\n\n# Instatiate a XGBClassifier \n\n\n# Inspect the parameters\n","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":408},"colab_type":"code","id":"8zMyC5qkegsM","outputId":"f51c4b33-9c7f-4ee2-f54e-b31ce36ec3bf"},"id":"45dd576b-3785-46b5-94db-a2c39d54412c","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"There's a couple of things to note:\n- The `booster` parameter is `gbtree`.  This means the weak learners, or boosters, are decision trees in this model. `gbtree` is the default, and we will keep it this way.\n- The `objective` function, or loss function, is defined as `binary:logistic`. The objective function quantifies how far off a prediction is from the actual results. We want to minimize this to have the smallest possible loss. `binary:logistic` is the default for classifiers. `binary:logistic` outputs the actual predicted probability of the positive class (in our case, that a booking is cancelled).\n- `n_estimators` is the number of gradient boosted trees we want in our model. It's equivalent to the number of boosting rounds. For our purposes, we don't want too many boosting rounds, or training will take too long. **Let's lower it from 100 to 10**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/datacamp/Machine-Learning-With-XGboost-live-training/blob/master/assets/n_estimators.png?raw=true\" width = \"70%\"> \n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n- `max_depth` is the maximum tree depth allowed. Tree depth is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. Making this too high will give our model more variance, or more potential to overfit. Similar to `n_estimators`, the more we increase this, the longer our training period will be. **Let's keep this at 3**.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/datacamp/Machine-Learning-With-XGboost-live-training/blob/master/assets/max_depth.png?raw=true\" width = \"25%\"> \n</p>\n\n- For our `eval_metric` (evaluation metric for validation data), we will use `error` as defined by [XGBoost documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html):\n\n> Binary classification error rate. It is calculated as #(wrong cases)/#(all cases).
